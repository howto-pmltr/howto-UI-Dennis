##lPitch: Have a life hack? Share it on how-to. Posts with the most likes/reviews/tried its will be at the top of the feed. Simplifying life for everyone.

1. An on-boarding process for a new general user (user that will consume the service)
2. On-boarding process for user who wants to generate content (i.e. organize how-to tutorials)
3. Ability to easily create / setup a how - to guide
4. Ability to easily edit / delete an a how-to guide
5. Ability to easily view/ search / find /filter how-to guides

###Stretch: Add the ability to add photos and videos to be uploaded


##Proposal

###What problem does your app solve? Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
	
1. Having a lack of information about a problem, task, or new skills.
3. Provides a resource for users to find, share, and create tutorials and “how-to”s on various tasks and problems.

###What is the mission statement?

By alleviating the pain of lacking knowledge, we will give every individual on the planet the assets to learn how to do anything.

##Features

###What features are required for your minimum viable product?

1. Welcoming Interface for new users that differentiates for registered users
2. A way for users to sign up
3. A way for users to add a how to guide
4. Ability to write a guide and choose when guide is published, otherwise it stays in draft.
5. Ability to tag guides and filter through guides with keywords.
6. Ability to edit and delete post.

###Stretch: 
Interactive system for guides(ratings).
View users profiles which contain guides.
Comment on guide created.

##For Data Scientists
- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

##Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
People seeking to make life more efficient and streamline daily tasks.

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
N/A

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
N/A


##Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
